# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock

Overview:
This is a python, console game based off of big bang theory.

Problem and how I will solve it:
I will make this program flexible to where it will allow the game to reach different languages and cultures.

Plan:
I created a flow chart linked here() which will visualize how im going to efficently create this program.

Notes:
Need a clever way of visualizing the game to increase game design.

Implications:
This is a game based off of a tv show so I have looked into the legality of it and I should be fine as long as I give credit.

Version log:
Version log is located in this github project via history tab.

Evaluation:
Features for the future could involve a web based version of the game or even an implication of the Pygame module.
